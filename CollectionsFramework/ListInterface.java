    * it can have duplicate values.
    * list interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, vector and stack.
    * It is an ordered collection of objects in which duplicate values can be stored.
    * Since list preserves the insertion order, it allows positional access ND INSERTION OF ELEMENTS.
